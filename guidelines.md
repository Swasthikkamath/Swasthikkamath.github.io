- Use the [coding guidelines](https://github.com/mbits-mirafra/axi4_avip/blob/phase1_development_branch/coding_guidelines.md)
for code development:

- Use a separate Git branch to work for every feature or debug. [Link](https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/)

- Use a pull request to contribute your valuable work. [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
