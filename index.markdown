#### mBits is an initiative by the engineers at [Mirafra Technologies](https://www.mirafra.com). Our goal is to create a repository of high quality Verification IPs which are open-source and free to use.

#### All the VIPs will be developed with UVM following the best industry practices. They will come with comprehensive documentation and user guides. You can check the available VIPs on the [Projects](Projects) page.

#### All the code on in this repository is released under the permissive [MIT License](license).
